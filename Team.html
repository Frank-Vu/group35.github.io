                -Name: Vu Thanh Tung</br>
                -Student ID: s3963172</br>
                -Email: <a href="mailto:s3963172@rmit.edu.vn">s3963172@rmit.edu.vn</a></br>
                -Personal Interest: Technology fascinates me, whether it is consumer or enterprise
                technology. I am interested in how the technology industry operates. I usually conduct my
                research on YouTube or through articles I read online, such as how to build a PC, how to
                set up and run a local network system, how companies deal with security, and how large
                corporations like Google and Facebook store and use data.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have participated in numerous group projects throughout my high school
                career, so I am very confident in my ability to multitask, solve problems, and communicate
                effectively with my team members. I have some basic web design experience from a high
                school group project, as well as Python from YouTube and last semester at RMIT. With
                my prior experience in group projects and my interest in technology, I can participate in
                the project efficiently and effectively.</br>
                -Role: Team coordinator. In our group, I will be the member who will organize the group,
                assign tasks, accordingly, fill in the gaps of the group when needed, and make sure the
                project is on schedule.</br>
                -Reflection: During the past 12 weeks of the course, I have learnt a lot of things and also made some friends along the way. 
                The progress my group made is quite well even with our limited knowledge. Thanks to Minh and Dat that I have learnt a few things 
                about coding a website because they had experienced it before. Our communication is the group was very good also. We also almost 
                had a perfect streak of weekly online meeting and no one were ghosted in the group chat. I believed that we also did our best 
                possible job. But I believed that I could also improve myself a lot after this project. My time management is quite bad like I 
                have postponed the PowerPoint preparation at the very last end which did cost our team a sleepless night. Also, my ability to 
                wander off doing something else entirely is also a problem that I have to resolve next course.

                -Personal Interest: At first, after finishing high school, I didnâ€™t what to learn and decide to choose Engineer as my career path.</br>
                However, after 1 year of studying engineer, I feel like engineer is not made for me. Fortunately, I found out that I really like to learn coding and spend a lot of time in research and explore it.</br> 
                Therefore, I decide to choose IT as my career path and maybe aiming to become a game developer or game designer.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: Before I learn this course, I have learnt about basic HTML, CSS and C# </br>
                as these programming languages can help me a lot in my career path to become a professional developer.</br>
                -Role: Assistance. In our group, I will identify some potential risks during the time working on the project. </br>
                Therefore, working on thinking of ways to minimize those risks.</br>

                -Personal Interest: In the past, I have taken a lot of interest in video games, especially in
                how they are made and the techniques that developers have used for them.</br> As a result, I
                am now interested in learning coding languages and gaining experience on how to use them
                effectively and hopefully one day I can develop my own game.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have learned a few basic knowledge for coding in C++ and Python in the
                past but it is nothing serious.</br> I will continue to research and learn to build up my knowledge
                and experience in coding.</br>
                -Role: Back-end developer.</br> I will make sure that our webapp works properly and keep an eye on any issues with the app and fix them.</br>
                -Reflection: I am very surprised and impressed for how fast my team can learn and adapt while doing this 
                project.</br> For example, GitHub at first seemed to be very confusing to use but my team was able to
                use its features such as branches with great efficiency just in a week.</br> Even though most of our
                teammates are very busy with both college and life work, we managed to arrange a few meetings
                with each other to discuss about the project and at the end of each meeting,</br> everyone knew
                exactly what to do next for the project. From this project, I have learnt that any challenges can be 
                overcame with reliable teammates as these kinds of projects are almost impossible to do alone,</br> 
                especially with limited resources and time.</br>
            </p>

        <h1>Group Processes</h1>
        <p>Our group had been every cooperated. We had kept good progress from the beginning. 
            There was some slowdown during the middle semester because we also had other courses that took some of our time, but we did make it through. 
            Overall, our group agreed that we did as well as we could with our current knowledge and experience.</p>
        <h1>Career Plans</h1>
        <p>Our group, all have 4 different career plans. Minh chooses software engineer. Dat chooses cloud developer. Tung chooses network engineer. 
            And Nhat chooses data engineer. The career plans of software engineers, cloud engineers, network engineers, and data developers differ 
            in some ways but have many common elements. Each of these professionals has a different job outlook and skill set that they need 
            to succeed in their chosen field. However, all four of these roles require a strong technical background and the ability to stay 
            up-to-date on the latest technologies. Additionally, all four professionals must be able to communicate effectively with clients 
            and colleagues to ensure successful project completion. Although their career paths are different, each one requires dedication 
            and hard work to reach their goals. The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and the roles of software engineers, cloud engineers, 
            network engineers, and data developers are becoming increasingly important. Each position has its own unique set of skills and 
            responsibilities that differ from the others. Software engineers are responsible for developing software applications that meet 
            customer requirements. They must have a good understanding of coding languages such as Java or Python. Cloud engineers focus on 
            creating and managing cloud-based systems for businesses. Network engineers design and manage networks for large companies or 
            organizations. Data developers work with large datasets to develop insights into trends or patterns in data. Although these 
            positions may seem similar at first glance, they each require different sets of skills and knowledge to be successful in 
            their respective roles. It is important to understand the differences between them when considering which career path to 
            pursue. By understanding what makes each position unique, you can make an informed decision about which one best suits your interests and goals.</p>
