                -Name: Vu Thanh Tung</br>
                -Student ID: s3963172</br>
                -Email: <a href="mailto:s3963172@rmit.edu.vn">s3963172@rmit.edu.vn</a></br>
                -Personal Interest: Technology fascinates me, whether it is consumer or enterprise
                technology. I am interested in how the technology industry operates.</br>I usually conduct my
                research on YouTube or through articles I read online, such as how to build a PC, how to
                set up and run a local network system,</br>how companies deal with security, and how large
                corporations like Google and Facebook store and use data.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have participated in numerous group projects throughout my high school
                career, so I am very confident in my ability to multitask,</br>solve problems, and communicate
                effectively with my team members. I have some basic web design experience from a high
                school group project,</br>as well as Python from YouTube and last semester at RMIT. With
                my prior experience in group projects and my interest in technology,</br>I can participate in
                the project efficiently and effectively.</br>
                -Role: Team coordinator. In our group, I will be the member who will organize the group,
                assign tasks, accordingly,</br>fill in the gaps of the group when needed, and make sure the
                project is on schedule.</br>

        <h1>Group Processes</h1>
        <p>Our group had been every cooperated. We had kept good progress from the beginning. 
            There was some slowdown during the middle semester because we also had other courses that took some of our time, but we did make it through. 
            Overall, our group agreed that we did as well as we could with our current knowledge and experience.</p>
        <h1>Career Plans</h1>
        <p>Our group, all have 4 different career plans. Minh chooses software engineer. Dat chooses cloud developer. Tung chooses network engineer. 
            And Nhat chooses data engineer. The career plans of software engineers, cloud engineers, network engineers, and data developers differ 
            in some ways but have many common elements. Each of these professionals has a different job outlook and skill set that they need 
            to succeed in their chosen field. However, all four of these roles require a strong technical background and the ability to stay 
            up-to-date on the latest technologies. Additionally, all four professionals must be able to communicate effectively with clients 
            and colleagues to ensure successful project completion. Although their career paths are different, each one requires dedication 
            and hard work to reach their goals. The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and the roles of software engineers, cloud engineers, 
            network engineers, and data developers are becoming increasingly important. Each position has its own unique set of skills and 
            responsibilities that differ from the others. Software engineers are responsible for developing software applications that meet 
            customer requirements. They must have a good understanding of coding languages such as Java or Python. Cloud engineers focus on 
            creating and managing cloud-based systems for businesses. Network engineers design and manage networks for large companies or 
            organizations. Data developers work with large datasets to develop insights into trends or patterns in data. Although these 
            positions may seem similar at first glance, they each require different sets of skills and knowledge to be successful in 
            their respective roles. It is important to understand the differences between them when considering which career path to 
            pursue. By understanding what makes each position unique, you can make an informed decision about which one best suits your interests and goals.</p>
