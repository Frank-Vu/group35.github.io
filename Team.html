                -Name: Vu Thanh Tung</br>
                -Student ID: s3963172</br>

                -Personal Interest: Technology fascinates me, whether it is consumer or enterprise
                technology. I am interested in how the technology industry operates.</br>I usually conduct my
                research on YouTube or through articles I read online, such as how to build a PC, how to
                set up and run a local network system,</br>how companies deal with security, and how large
                corporations like Google and Facebook store and use data.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have participated in numerous group projects throughout my high school
                career, so I am very confident in my ability to multitask,</br>solve problems, and communicate
                effectively with my team members. I have some basic web design experience from a high
                school group project,</br>as well as Python from YouTube and last semester at RMIT. With
                my prior experience in group projects and my interest in technology,</br>I can participate in
                the project efficiently and effectively.</br>
                -Role: Team coordinator. In our group, I will be the member who will organize the group,
                assign tasks, accordingly,</br>fill in the gaps of the group when needed, and make sure the
                project is on schedule.</br>

                -Personal Interest: In the past, I have taken a lot of interest in video games, especially in
                how they are made and the techniques that developers have used for them.</br> As a result, I
                am now interested in learning coding languages and gaining experience on how to use them
                effectively and hopefully one day I can develop my own game.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have learned a few basic knowledge for coding in C++ and Python in the
                past but it is nothing serious.</br> I will continue to research and learn to build up my knowledge
                and experience in coding.</br>
                -Role: Back-end developer.</br> I will make sure that our webapp works properly and keep an eye on any issues with the app and fix them.</br>
                -Reflection: I am very surprised and impressed for how fast my team can learn and adapt while doing this 
                project.</br> For example, GitHub at first seemed to be very confusing to use but my team was able to
                use its features such as branches with great efficiency just in a week.</br> Even though most of our
                teammates are very busy with both college and life work, we managed to arrange a few meetings
                with each other to discuss about the project and at the end of each meeting,</br> everyone knew
                exactly what to do next for the project. From this project, I have learnt that any challenges can be 
                overcame with reliable teammates as these kinds of projects are almost impossible to do alone,</br> 
                especially with limited resources and time.</br>
