        <h1>TOPIC</h1>
        <p>
            We suggest developing tools to help you plan, manage, and organize to improve workplace efficiency. Inspired by monday.com™ [1] and Slack [2].
            Their statistical reports reveal over 152,000 customers on monday.com™ [3], over 200,000 customers on Slack [4], Universal, Coca-Cola [5], Netflix, Uber
            [6] and more. many famous brands trust them. All the above data showed the need and contributed to the improvement of this application. Our focus is to
            develop applications for small businesses first, then for businesses to easily manage their employees, distribute tasks, improve efficiency and facilitate
            collaboration. It will be a web application that provides users with an access point to the information, notifications, and tasks they need. It also
            works seamlessly with other applications such as Microsoft Office Suit/Google Workspace, conferencing applications, and cloud services to4
            make your workflow more convenient and smoother. In summary, our application focuses on usability, collaboration, organization, management and scheduling. 
        </p>
     
        <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
        <p>
            Many equipment and technologies have been created as technology continues to advance daily to assist us in performing routine daily jobs quickly and
            effectively. by providing better yield than the conventional technique with the use of machines that assist farmers with planting, watering, fertilizing, and
            harvesting. Workers in industries can lift and move products more swiftly with the aid of machines than they can by hand. machines that help manufacturers
            in mass producing goods more quickly and cheaply. Tools that help organizations of all sizes, from tiny businesses to giant corporations, become
            more effective, structured, managed, and operational. 
        </p>
       
        <h1>LANDSCAPE</h1>
        <p>
            After researching 2 applications that have been used heavily in workplaces, Slack and monday.com, we see that they both had some features like message, call, and send file. 
            message, call, and send file. But Slack, they have a feature that focuses on specifying roles in the group so people can identify themselves and others to
            better collab and be responsible for their job. And on monday.com, they have a feature to show the progress of all members of the team and show the
            status, and percentage, and if they have done, they can notify the next responsible role. We want to combine both features in one app. 
        </p>
        <h1>AIMS</h1>
        <p>
            Our most important aim while creating this scheduling webapp is to improve every day work 
            efficiency. We wanted an app that can improve users’ ability to plan, prioritize their work and
            perform them productively. To achieve this, we must first work on the most important feature 
            that makes a scheduling app a scheduling app: the calendar. We must design a calendar that 
            display accurate dates and time, including holidays and leap year dates. To improve useability, 
            we will include a few easy-to-use tools such as “sticky notes” to write reminders on each date or 
            time. The user will also have the option to customize the calendar with different border colors, 
            text font style and, of course, the ability to fill each date or time with different colors depends on 
            how important that date or time is. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason for us to make this app is that we want to help workers to form teams and to keep 
            track of each other’s work, making collaboration easy and accessible. For that, we planned to 
            include the roster management feature. This feature will let workers form teams with each other, 
            as well as synchronize everyone calendars into one. It will display the name of every member in 
            the team for everyone, while whoever created the team is assigned as Manager by default and 
            have the option to assign other members their own roles. The synchronized calendar will merge 
            every team member’s shifts and marked dates and time into together, which will be applied for 
            everyone in the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this app to truly help with improving work efficiency, it needs to be able to automatically do 
            simple tasks for the users. The synchronized calendar mentioned above will have a system that 
            detects any conflicts between the team members’ shifts and automatically notify them about it. 
            Additionally, the app will have a booking system which will offer the ‘customer’ to 
            automatically book for them appointments with employees from different companies. After a 
            request for an appointment, the app will communicate with the company side and notify the 
            Manager of the team. From here, the Manager can choose to either assign an employee by 
            themselves or tell the app to automatically choose an employee and an available time for that appointment. 
        </p>                                  
        
        <h1>PLANS AND PROGRESS</h1>
        <p>
            For the first week of Intro to IT, there was nothing to do since this is the first time we met each other and got to know about each other habits, likes, and so on. Next, we
            decided to use Microsoft Team, Discord, and Messenger as our three main meeting methods and discuss what to do for our project assessment at the end of this course.
            After a few meetings, we decided to design a scheduling and project-managing web app as our main topic. Next, we discussed whether to do the early feedback assignment to
            ensure our idea, and ultimately, we had chosen to do it. For the second week, we assigned tasks and roles, set the deadline for each person, and researched important
            features of our project idea. In week 3, all of us went on Discord to have a meeting and brainstormed together about features and ideas, after 1 hour of brainstorming, we
            decided that Vu Thanh Tung do the Topic session, Chu Khai Minh with Scope, Pham Minh Nhat with Communication and Le Quang Dat with the Risk session for our project
            proposal. Once Tung got stuck in understanding the requirements of the Topic session in the group project proposal which is the missing details of statistics, scenarios, and
            analysis about our website, so he asked other members to help him out since the deadline was near that time. After discussing and researching online for materials, we
            managed to find the best resource that fits our needs which is Monday.com.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 4 was one of our most frustrating weeks during this course as we had to both learn and revise to prepare for the two other courses tests which were Intro to
            Programming and Intro to Computer Systems and focused on designing UX/UI by Le Quang Dat, researched HTML by Chu Khai Minh, analyzed CSS by Pham Minh Nhat and
            finally explored JS by Vu Thanh Tung. However, since our time was limited, therefore, we needed week 5 to finish our research about those features because they were
            important for our project. Additionally, we added some minor details like a calendar and sticky notes at the end of week 5 too. Next week 6, we moved to other essentials factor:
            multi-use in many devices and software, notification about the conflict between two or three events, and identifying “Booking” features. Since we had finished those tests from
            week 4, we were able to accomplish our tasks easily and had enough time for our daily habits and move to the next step of our project. Into week 7, we continued our progress
            and move on to the next feature which was building the “Booking” feature for Customers and Employees. Additionally, since Tung had already done his research on it
            and Nhat had finished his work too, therefore, both of them decided to help Dat and Minh with the “Booking” feature to minimize the time spent on this element. In week 8,
            we began to finalize our progress by writing the background and summarizing our project. By doing this, we were able to move on to writing the report for the final
            assignment and prepare for the presentation coming in week 11. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During week 9, we decided on whom to do what tasks for the report and in the end, Tung would do the team profile, overview of our report, and our project prototype. Next,
            Nhat wrote the testing and the Skills & Jobs, Minh wrote the Roles, Scope & Limits and Group processes & Communication and last Dat wrote the Plans and Progress. While
            writing the report, we also needed to assign whom to present the essential factor in our project which is Scheduling and Project-manage web app and rehearsal of our
            presentation for having more confidence and being ready to present in front of the class. On the other hand, one of our members had learned about Figma: a collaborative
            interface design tool, which was easy to use and get familiar with, therefore, by using Figma we could design our website interface with ease. Although some of us had
            difficulty trying to use Figma, we still overcome it and finish the design of our website. After finishing the presentation, which was on week 11, we kept on writing our report to
            keep on track with the deadline date to ensure there would be no mark deduction inside our project report. Finally, in week 12, after researching and learning HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, our group developed the prototype of our website to finish the assignment after all of our hard work from week 2 until week 12. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, summarize all of our work from week 1 to week 12, we have learnt how to design a website by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript combine with GitHub. Additionally,
            we also learn how to manage our time effectively between work and daily life. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>ROLES</h1>
        <p>
        For this project, we have defined four roles for our team: Team Coordinator, Front-end 
        Developer, Back-end Developer, and Team Assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
        - The Team Coordinator, which is similar to the leader of team, is the one who overlooks the 
        entire project and their team, assigns tasks accordingly to each member. He or she is also the one 
        who arranges time for group meetings, makes sure that everyone knows exactly what to do and 
        the project to be on schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
        - The Front-end Developer is responsible for designing the overall layout of the webapp. He or she
        will be that one that create the interface, makes which part of the app does what, and determines 
        the look of the webapp. Creating a slick and modern look for webapp is essential in attracting
        and keeping users to use the app.
        </p>
        <p>
        - The Back-end Developer is the one who will be dealing with data and internal systems of the
        webapp. Unlike the Front-end who determines the look of the webapp, the Back-end builds and 
        maintain mechanisms that process data and performs action on the webapp. He or she is usually
        involved in data, storage, security and many things that are hidden away from the user. It is 
        extremely important to make sure the webapp works correctly at all times and maintaining that 
        status can help with satisfying the users. 
        </p>
        <p>
        - Team Assistant’s job is to either assist other roles in their work and take some of their workload 
        off or attend to menial tasks while letting the team’s members focus on their tasks. He or she can 
        also can help the Team Coordinator in arranging group meetings and reminding team members 
        of their tasks. Like in the name, the Team Assistant’s purpose is to ‘assist’ other roles in order to 
        keeping everyone focused on the project and potentially speed up the process. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>SCOPE AND LIMITS</h1>
        <p>
            At first, we were very ambitious about this project, were constantly talk to each other about what ideas to put into this webapp and how to implement them. But we soon
            realized our pile of ideas became too big, and the lack of resources, knowledge and especially time were against our ambition. Eventually, we have to limit our scope down
            and prioritize a few features that were deemed essential for the app. Here are the features that are currently in our scope: 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Calendar: The core of a scheduling webapp. The calendar will display accurate dates and times, including dates for leap years. From here, you can mark any dates and times with
            different colors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Role management: Users will be able to form teams with each other, and the one who created the team will automatically be assigned as the manager by default. The manager then can set roles for
            team members and also will be able to track the work progression of each person. Events, deadline, and team meetings dates will all be assigned by the manager and will be
            displayed on the calendar for members to see. Team members will have to ability to set their own work status such as Done, Working on it, or Stuck so the manager can
            understand their current situation.  
        </p>
        <p>
            - Synchronization: When a person is added to a team, they will have the option to let the app automatically synchronize his/her calendar with the rest of their team members’. The user will be able
            to put every team member’s work shift, marked dates and time, “sticky notes”, available time and many more into his/her calendar. If the app detects any conflicts, such as your
            marked date is the same as somebody else’s, it will notify the user and present a few suggestions for the user for how to solve them.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, we had to scrap a few ideas since we since we lack the resources, knowledge, and time for them. Here is the list of the ideas that are out-of-scope: 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Booking: We plan to have two version of the app: one for customer, and one for company. The customer version is for users to book an appointment with a company that also uses the
            webapp. The company side is the one with the features mentioned in the in-scope list and to receive appointment requests from customers.  
        </p>
        <p>
            - Email notification: The app will send emails to remind the user if an important date is nearby. It will notify the user 24 hours, 12 hours, and 3 hours before the marked time. This feature can be
            turned off at any time through the option menu. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - SMS notification: Works exactly the same way as Email Notification, except it is through phone messages. Again, this feature can be turned off through the option menu. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
        <p>
            For the tools and software, we used in the Project include: 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Discord: A social network for VoIP and instant chatting is called Discord. Users have the option to connect with one another via phone calls, video calls, text
            messages, media files, and private chats or as members of groups known as "servers." 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Messager: A messaging app with VoIP, owed by Meta.  
        </p>
        <p>
            - GitHub: a Git-based version management system and hosting service for software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Visual Studio Code: a source-code editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS that Microsoft created using the Electron Framework. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>TESTING</h1>
        <p>
            We cannot construct a new web application due to a lack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Therefore, we create a prototype and design the website's UX/UI. In the prototype,
            users are required to interact and accomplish certain tasks with the website, and then provide feedback following testing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we will devise a strategy for recruiting several test users. For instance, we can survey a group of ten university students who will be entering the workforce shortly or a
            group of five teachers/professors at RMIT University who require a system that can automatically check their calendars and add tanks and appointments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, during the test, users are requested to do certain tasks, such as writing a book, inviting people to an event, reviewing team assignments and responsibilities, etc. There
            will be a time limit of 8-10 minutes. Then, we capture the entirety of the user's interaction with the web application. The rationale for this is that we want to know how
            successful they are at achieving their goals and what deters them from making progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all, we provide them with a feedback form so they can elaborate on the (in)convenience, goal misunderstanding, and development opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, once we have the records and user input, we will create a report for analysis and evaluation. Then, designers and code developers will eliminate the inconvenience and
            enhance the quickest method for accomplishing goals in web applications.
        </p>
        
        <h1>RISKS</h1>
        <p>
        Risks are impossible to be avoided when working on these kinds of projects. Therefore, it is 
        important for us to identify any possible risks that can prevent us from keep on working on this 
        project. Here is a list of risks that we have identified so far:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Prototype: Our team has decided to create a prototype in Figma for this project to both
            get a better understanding of our plan and to have something to show for our lecturer. 
            Of course, creating a prototype is not an easy task. Some of our ideas for the features of our 
            app were very difficult to implement into Figma and, without the right knowledge or
            experience, could slow down our progress on making the prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
        - Research: It is easy to come up with an idea but to fully understand that idea is the hard 
        part. Like we mentioned in our scope, we came up with a lot of ideas for features but 
        eventually also had to scrap a lot of them for being complicated. There is no guarantee 
        that we would also fully understand the ideas that are currently in our scope. Some of us
        might falsely assume a feature works in a different way other than it is intended to be 
        which could lead to imprecise information in our report or presentation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        - HTML: While writing this report, we also had to create a website to put our report into it. 
        As a requirement from the assignment given to us by our lecturer, the website must be 
        created using HTML. Since we are still very new to HTML, we might, from time to time, 
        make mistakes while making the website. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
        <p>
        For most of the semester, most of us are very busy and barely had any time to meet face-to-face 
        with each other. Some of us are busy with other courses or real-life work. We needed a way to
        not just effectively communicate with each other but also to share our files, keep track of each 
        other’s progress and arranging online meetings. For those reasons, we have chosen 3 ways of 
        communication:
        </p>
        <p>
        - Discord: Discord is a very reliable way for us to both share files and have group calls. We 
        also created multiple channels for different purposes: a channel dedicated to sharing links 
        and files, a channel dedicated to technical support, and a channel dedicated to announcements. 
        </p>
        <p>
        - Messenger: We used Messenger to send casual messages, quick reminders and as a
        backup meeting app.
        </p>
        <p>
        - Physical meetings: Once in a while, we were able to squeeze in some time for physical 
        meetings on campus, usually after the tutorial class. During these meetings, we would use 
        as much as possible to work on projects side by side as we felt that physical meetings are 
        still more effective than online ones.
        </p>
         <p>
         Even though most of are busy and hardly have any time for physical meetings, we still held a 
         few group meetings online through the apps mentioned above. We agreed to have at least one 
         online meeting per week to share our ideas, assign each other’s tasks and keep track of our 
         progress. Of course, we also have to enforce a few rules to make sure everyone would show up 
         on meetings, such as if he/she is not presence in multiple group meetings without any reasoning 
         then they will be reported to the teacher, which will possibly leads to point deduction and so on.
         </p>
