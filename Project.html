        <h1>TOPIC</h1>
        <p>
            We suggest developing tools to help you plan, manage, and organize to improve workplace efficiency. Inspired by monday.com™ [1] and Slack [2].
            Their statistical reports reveal over 152,000 customers on monday.com™ [3], over 200,000 customers on Slack [4], Universal, Coca-Cola [5], Netflix, Uber
            [6] and more. many famous brands trust them. All the above data showed the need and contributed to the improvement of this application. Our focus is to
            develop applications for small businesses first, then for businesses to easily manage their employees, distribute tasks, improve efficiency and facilitate
            collaboration. It will be a web application that provides users with an access point to the information, notifications, and tasks they need. It also
            works seamlessly with other applications such as Microsoft Office Suit/Google Workspace, conferencing applications, and cloud services to4
            make your workflow more convenient and smoother. In summary, our application focuses on usability, collaboration, organization, management and scheduling. 
        </p>
     
        <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
        <p>
            Many equipment and technologies have been created as technology continues to advance daily to assist us in performing routine daily jobs quickly and
            effectively. by providing better yield than the conventional technique with the use of machines that assist farmers with planting, watering, fertilizing, and
            harvesting. Workers in industries can lift and move products more swiftly with the aid of machines than they can by hand. machines that help manufacturers
            in mass producing goods more quickly and cheaply. Tools that help organizations of all sizes, from tiny businesses to giant corporations, become
            more effective, structured, managed, and operational. 
        <p>
         
        <h1>LANDSCAPE</h1>
        
        <h1>AIMS</h1>
        <p>
            Our most important aim while creating this scheduling webapp is to improve every day work 
            efficiency. We wanted an app that can improve users’ ability to plan, prioritize their work and
            perform them productively. To achieve this, we must first work on the most important feature 
            that makes a scheduling app a scheduling app: the calendar. We must design a calendar that 
            display accurate dates and time, including holidays and leap year dates. To improve useability, 
            we will include a few easy-to-use tools such as “sticky notes” to write reminders on each date or 
            time. The user will also have the option to customize the calendar with different border colors, 
            text font style and, of course, the ability to fill each date or time with different colors depends on 
            how important that date or time is. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason for us to make this app is that we want to help workers to form teams and to keep 
            track of each other’s work, making collaboration easy and accessible. For that, we planned to 
            include the roster management feature. This feature will let workers form teams with each other, 
            as well as synchronize everyone calendars into one. It will display the name of every member in 
            the team for everyone, while whoever created the team is assigned as Manager by default and 
            have the option to assign other members their own roles. The synchronized calendar will merge 
            every team member’s shifts and marked dates and time into together, which will be applied for 
            everyone in the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this app to truly help with improving work efficiency, it needs to be able to automatically do 
            simple tasks for the users. The synchronized calendar mentioned above will have a system that 
            detects any conflicts between the team members’ shifts and automatically notify them about it. 
            Additionally, the app will have a booking system which will offer the ‘customer’ to 
            automatically book for them appointments with employees from different companies. After a 
            request for an appointment, the app will communicate with the company side and notify the 
            Manager of the team. From here, the Manager can choose to either assign an employee by 
            themselves or tell the app to automatically choose an employee and an available time for that appointment. 
        </p>                                  
        
        <h1>PLANS AND PROGRESS</h1>
        
        <h1>ROLES</h1>
        <p>
        For this project, we have defined four roles for our team: Team Coordinator, Front-end 
        Developer, Back-end Developer, and Team Assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Team Coordinator, which is similar to the leader of team, is the one who overlooks the 
        entire project and their team, assigns tasks accordingly to each member. He or she is also the one 
        who arranges time for group meetings, makes sure that everyone knows exactly what to do and 
        the project to be on schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Front-end Developer is responsible for designing the overall layout of the webapp. He or she
        will be that one that create the interface, makes which part of the app does what, and determines 
        the look of the webapp. Creating a slick and modern look for webapp is essential in attracting
        and keeping users to use the app.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Back-end Developer is the one who will be dealing with data and internal systems of the
        webapp. Unlike the Front-end who determines the look of the webapp, the Back-end builds and 
        maintain mechanisms that process data and performs action on the webapp. He or she is usually
        involved in data, storage, security and many things that are hidden away from the user. It is 
        extremely important to make sure the webapp works correctly at all times and maintaining that 
        status can help with satisfying the users. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Team Assistant’s job is to either assist other roles in their work and take some of their workload 
        off or attend to menial tasks while letting the team’s members focus on their tasks. He or she can 
        also can help the Team Coordinator in arranging group meetings and reminding team members 
        of their tasks. Like in the name, the Team Assistant’s purpose is to ‘assist’ other roles in order to 
        keeping everyone focused on the project and potentially speed up the process. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>SCOPE AND LIMITS</h1>
        
        <h1>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
        
        <h1>TESTING</h1>
        
        
        <h1>RISKS</h1>
        <p>
        Risks are impossible to be avoided when working on these kinds of projects. Therefore, it is 
        important for us to identify any possible risks that can prevent us from keep on working on this 
        project. Here is a list of risks that we have identified so far:
        </p>
        <p>
            Prototype: Our team has decided to create a prototype in Figma for this project to both
            get a better understanding of our plan and to have something to show for our lecturer. 
            Of course, creating a prototype is not an easy task. Some of our ideas for the features of our 
            app were very difficult to implement into Figma and, without the right knowledge or
            experience, could slow down our progress on making the prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
        Research: It is easy to come up with an idea but to fully understand that idea is the hard 
        part. Like we mentioned in our scope, we came up with a lot of ideas for features but 
        eventually also had to scrap a lot of them for being complicated. There is no guarantee 
        that we would also fully understand the ideas that are currently in our scope. Some of us
        might falsely assume a feature works in a different way other than it is intended to be 
        which could lead to imprecise information in our report or presentation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        HTML: While writing this report, we also had to create a website to put our report into it. 
        As a requirement from the assignment given to us by our lecturer, the website must be 
        created using HTML. Since we are still very new to HTML, we might, from time to time, 
        make mistakes while making the website. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
        <p>
        For most of the semester, most of us are very busy and barely had any time to meet face-to-face 
        with each other. Some of us are busy with other courses or real-life work. We needed a way to
        not just effectively communicate with each other but also to share our files, keep track of each 
        other’s progress and arranging online meetings. For those reasons, we have chosen 3 ways of 
        communication:
        </p
        <p>
        Discord: Discord is a very reliable way for us to both share files and have group calls. We 
        also created multiple channels for different purposes: a channel dedicated to sharing links 
        and files, a channel dedicated to technical support, and a channel dedicated to announcements. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Messenger: We used Messenger to send casual messages, quick reminders and as a
        backup meeting app.
        </p>
        <p>
        Physical meetings: Once in a while, we were able to squeeze in some time for physical 
        meetings on campus, usually after the tutorial class. During these meetings, we would use 
        as much as possible to work on projects side by side as we felt that physical meetings are 
        still more effective than online ones.
        </p>
         <p>
         Even though most of are busy and hardly have any time for physical meetings, we still held a 
         few group meetings online through the apps mentioned above. We agreed to have at least one 
         online meeting per week to share our ideas, assign each other’s tasks and keep track of our 
         progress. Of course, we also have to enforce a few rules to make sure everyone would show up 
         on meetings, such as if he/she is not presence in multiple group meetings without any reasoning 
         then they will be reported to the teacher, which will possibly leads to point deduction and so on.
