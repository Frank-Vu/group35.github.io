        <h1>Prototype - Figma</h1>
        <p>For our prototype, we have basic navigation and UI to show what our app will be like if deploy in the future. 
            We have implemented a popup menu when clicking on the date of the calendar. We also have added a login page, 
            2 tabs like the homepage, and a created team page. We tried to improve the efficiency of the workplace in 
            small businesses to corporations in a more collaborative way. We also heavily focus on ease of use to improve 
            accessibility and adaptability to new and old workflow. Right now, you can navigate in our prototype with basic 
            pop-up menu options. The limitation of our prototype is that it can not visually the other core features that we 
            want to implement in our application like auto booking and auto-assign members. In the future, we want to improve 
            the UI of the application and focus on ease of use more like how we can place things differently. And we do want 
            to have a working application that runs on Electron to test our other core features.</p>
