                -Name: Chu Khai Minh</br>
                -Student ID: s3864172</br>

                -Personal Interest: In the past, I have taken a lot of interest in video games, especially in
                how they are made and the techniques that developers have used for them.</br> As a result, I
                am now interested in learning coding languages and gaining experience on how to use them
                effectively and hopefully one day I can develop my own game.</br>
                -Relevant Skills: I have learned a few basic knowledge for coding in C++ and Python in the
                past but it is nothing serious.</br> I will continue to research and learn to build up my knowledge
                and experience in coding.</br>
                -Role: Back-end developer.</br> I will make sure that our webapp works properly and keep an eye on any issues with the app and fix them.</br>
                -Reflection: I am very surprised and impressed for how fast my team can learn and adapt while doing this 
                project.</br> For example, GitHub at first seemed to be very confusing to use but my team was able to
                use its features such as branches with great efficiency just in a week.</br> Even though most of our
                teammates are very busy with both college and life work, we managed to arrange a few meetings
                with each other to discuss about the project and at the end of each meeting,</br> everyone knew
                exactly what to do next for the project. From this project, I have learnt that any challenges can be 
                overcame with reliable teammates as these kinds of projects are almost impossible to do alone,</br> 
                especially with limited resources and time.</br>
